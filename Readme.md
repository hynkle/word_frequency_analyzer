A small tool to analyze the frequency of words in a given text, written for my aunt who very much wants to make sure she's not saying "actually" too much.

Paste in a chunk of text, paste in a list of stop words (words you don't care about: "a", "the", "is", etc.), and hit the button.

You can see it in action [here](http://hynkle.com/tools/word-frequency).
